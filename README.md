## Advantages of participating in Data Science Competitions

* You have a lot to gain and practically nothing to lose by participating in these competitions. It has both tangible and intangible benefits like:

    ** Great opportunity for learning.
    ** Getting exposed to state of the art approaches and datasets.
    ** Networking with like-minded people. Working in teams is even great since it helps to think over a problem from different perspectives.
    ** Showcasing your talent to the world and a chance of getting recruited
    ** It is also fun to participate and see how you fare on the leaderboard.
    ** The prize is an added bonus but shouldnâ€™t be the sole criteria.
